        An entity can be anything that is relevant to health care. It usually represents a disease or a
        pathogen, but it can also be an isolated symptom</p>

        <br>
        <p>Linearization is a constrained subset of the Foundation Component, which serves a particular
            purpose. For example, the ICD-11 MMS can be used for statistical reporting purposes, while other
            linearization, such as the Primary Care or Clinical Care. The consistency is ensured by the fact that
            every codable entity in a linearization is linked to its corresponding Foundation entity.</p>

        <h1 class="headline">Code structure</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The codes of the ICD–11 is alphanumeric and are referred to as stem codes. The structure of
            stem codes is described below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first character of the code always relates to the chapter number. It may be a number or
                    a letter.</li>
                    <li>Codes starting with ‘X’ indicate an extension code</li>
                    <li>There is always a letter in the second position to differentiate ICD-11 codes from the codes
                        in ICD–10</li>
                        <li>The inclusion of a forced number at the third character position prevents spelling
                            undesirable words.</li>
                            <li>The letters ‘O’ and ‘I’ are omitted to prevent confusion with the numbers ‘0’ and ‘1’</li>

            <p>Codes in the Tabular list of ICD-11 that can be used alone. Stem codes may be entities or
                groupings of high relevance in any of the use cases, or clinical conditions that should always be
                described as one single category. Stem codes are designed to ensure that in use cases that require
                only one code per case, meaningful information is collected.</p>

                <p>The post-coordination system allows adding more detail to an entity in a linearization.
                    Meanwhile, the pre-coordinated entity is formed by combining the parent with the post-

                    <p>Extension codes are comprised of groups of codes that contain entity hierarchies and may be
                        used to add detail to a stem code. Extension codes are not to be used alone in the context of
                        statistical classification but must be added to a stem code. Also, it can be used as value sets for post-
                        coordination axes</p>
