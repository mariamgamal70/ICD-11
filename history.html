    <p>Some of the first attempts to systematically classify diseases were made in the 1600s and
        1700s, though the resulting classifications were considered to be of little utility, largely as a result of
        inconsistencies in nomenclature and poor statistical data. During the 1800s the importance of
        creating a uniform system was realized, and several medical statisticians commissioned the
        completion of that task. The International Statistical Institute adopted the first international
        classification of diseases in 1893. The system was based on the Bertillon Classification of Causes of
        Death, developed by French statistician and demographer Jacques Bertillon. In 1898 the American
        Public Health Association recommended that Canada, Mexico, and the United States use that system
        and that it be revised every decade. In the following years Bertillonâ€™s classification became known as
        the International List of Causes of Death and ultimately as the ICD.</p>
    <p>ICD-11, was adopted by the 72nd World Health Assembly in 2019 and came into effect on
        1st January 2022</p>

        <h1>Improvements over the years</h1>
        <p>The main improves between ICD versions is in the number of diseases it contains and the
            way of coding diseases.</p>
